Nice idea 👌 A **project manager** is one of those products that can be *simple but powerful* if you design it right. I’ll break this down in **layers**, from MVP → advanced → “this feels premium”.

---

## 1️⃣ Core / MVP Features (non-negotiable)

These are the features without which it’s not a project manager.

### 📁 Projects

* Create / edit / archive projects
* Project description & objectives
* Status: `Planning · Active · On Hold · Completed`
* Start & end dates

### 👥 Team & Roles

* Invite users to a project
* Roles:

  * Admin / Manager
  * Member
  * Viewer
* Permissions (who can edit, assign, delete)

### ✅ Tasks

* Create tasks inside a project
* Task fields:

  * Title
  * Description
  * Status (`To Do / In Progress / Done`)
  * Priority
  * Due date
  * Assignee(s)
* Subtasks
* Task comments (discussion thread)

### 📊 Basic Views

* List view
* Kanban board (drag & drop)
* Simple project progress (% completed)

👉 **If you ship only this**, you already have a usable product.

## 2️⃣ Productivity Features (makes it *good*)

This is where people start preferring your tool.

## 3️⃣ Collaboration & Workflow (makes it *serious*)

## 7️⃣ Mobile & UX (don’t ignore this)

---

## 8️⃣ MVP Recommendation (if *you* were my client)

Given your background (business + software mindset), I’d say:

**Phase 1 (30–45 days)**

* Projects
* Tasks + subtasks
* Kanban + List
* Team roles
* Comments
* Notifications

**Phase 2**

* Time tracking
* Reports
* Gantt
* Templates

**Phase 3**

* Automation
* AI insights
* Integrations

## 9️⃣ One important question (this decides everything)

Before coding anything, answer this:

> ❓ **Who is this for?**

* Freelancers?
* Small businesses?
* Agencies?
* Internal company teams?
* Construction / IT / Marketing?

The **features stay similar**, but **UX, pricing, and priorities change completely**.

If you want, next I can:

* Help you **define a niche**
* Design **DB schema**
* Suggest **tech stack**
* Or help you plan this as a **sellable SaaS**

Just tell me where you want to go next 🚀
